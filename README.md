## The Situation

As many students are socializing from a distance, keeping track of all of pinging group members, club meetings, and other social tasks becomes a chore. Our group wanted to tackle this issue in the location where issues most frequently occurred: Discord.

## The Task

We initially thought gamifying Discord communities would improve social function, but soon realized the importance of organization for these communities, and the lack there of that affected them. We tasked ourselves with developing a Discord bot meant for small communities looking to set reminders in specific channels, @ specific users, and store it in a persistent way that makes managing these reminders easy.

## The Action

We started by constructing a skeleton for our project. We made the shell of a Discord bot using discord.js and Node, and a backend database using MongoDB. We then took to a Google Document to describe the actions and expectations users would take when interacting with our bot. These commands would take place in the command-line input style of the Discord messaging system. We then began building and testing JavaScript that could parse user's input and create JSON events. These events were then sent to the MongoDB. At this point, we had run out of time but we had big hopes in adding other features to the bot such as games, creating and adding roles, and more.

## The Result

We learned a lot! While the project isn't super flushed out, we're content with what we made as many of us are still learning JavaScript. This was also a great experience for learning out parsing and data collection works. Our bot is on GitHub and hosted live on Heroku for anyone looking to add it.
